# Figure data and code for the CAVE paper

This repository provides the necessary data and code to reproduce all data figures in the CAVE paper. 

Ensure you have all required libraries installed by running

```
cd CAVEpaper
pip install -r requiremnts.txt
```

The code is organized by figures and can be found in `/notebooks`. Figures are generated in `/figures`. `/data` provides preprocessed dataframes from which the figures were generated.
